                    <h1>Magnus Effect</h1>
                    <p>The Magnus Effect states that the "Force generated by a spinning object travelling through a
                        fluid (including air.) The force is perpindicular to the velocity of the object. The direction
                        of spin dictates the orientation of the Magnus force on the object."</p>
                    <p>The Magnus Effect ties in with Bernoulli's theorem with the different pressures acting
                        upon the object as it's in the fluid and in motion, this is discussed in more detail below. The
                        Magnus Effect is why soccer players can curve a soccer ball. A spinning ball in motion exerts a
                        net force in the fluid, which according to Newton's Third Law Of Motion, it exerts and equal
                        and opposite force back on the spinning object, altering it's trajectory which is shown in the
                        image on the right.</p>
                    <p>The Magnus Effect can be calulated with:</p>

                    <p>$$Fm = S \times (w \times v)$$</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fm = The Magnus Force.</li>
                        <li>S = Air resistance across the surface of the object.</li>
                        <li>w = Angular velocity of the object.</li>
                        <li>v = Velocity of the fluid.</li>

                    <h1>Bernoulli's Principle</h1>
                    <p>Bernoulli's Principle can be obtained from Issac Newton's "Second Law Of Motion". If a volume of
                        fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, then
                        there is more pressure behind it than infront of it. This gives a Σ force on the volume, which
                        results in an acceleration on the streamline.

                <h1>Reynolds Number (Re)</h1>
                <p>Reynolds Number is used in fluid dynamics to help indicate the prediction of flow patterns in
                    different fluid flow situations. Almost all ball games are played with a Reynold's Number between
                    40,000 to 400,000.</p>
                <p>Reynolds Number can be calculated with:</p>
                <p>$$Re = {U \times d \over \nu}$$</p>

                <h1>Lift</h1>
                <p>Lift acts upon every object differently, from an airplane to a soccer ball. Lift on ball's will be
                    discussed more in this section. The flow is turned in one direction and the lift is generated
                    in the opposite direction (Newton's Third Law). </p>
                <p>Ball lift can be calculated with:</p>
                <p>$$L = {4\over3} \times {(4 \times \pi^2 \times b^3 \times s \times \rho \times V)} $$</p>

                <h1>Drag</h1>
                <p>With Newton's third law "With every reaction, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Therefore
                    Drag is the opposing force to the direction of motion. Without drag, an object will remain in
                    motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force (Newton's First Law).</p>
                <p>Drag can be calculated with:</p>
                <p>$$F_D = C_d \times {1\over 2} \times \rho \times V^2 \times A$$</p>

                <h1>Golf Ball Aerodynamics</h1>
                <p>A golf ball has about 500 dimples and have a depth of about 0.0254
                    centimetres. The dimples are used
                    to increase the amount of surface area. Dimples also effect lift. Just like a plane wing. The air
                    pressure at the bottom of the ball is higher than the air pressure at the top of the ball, this
                    imbalance creates creates the upward force. The balls backwards spin adds to about half the lift
                    the balls lift, whereas the other half is contributed by the dimples in the ball.</p>

                <h1>Tennis Ball Aerodynamics</h1>
                <p>A tennis ball's "fuzz" causes early transition from the very smooth flow to a very rough flow to
                    keep the ball stable in the air. Since the world's fastest serve is $263.4km^{-1}$ or
                    $73.17ms^{-1}$. Tennis had to introduce a way to slow down the ball, this is where the "fuzz" is
                    used to slow the ball down due to an increased surface area which also increases the drag
                    coefficient, decreasing the Reynolds Number. (The higher the Drag coefficient the lower the Re
                    (from &asymp; 150,000 Re to &asymp; 50,000)).</p>

                <h1>Soccer Ball Aerodynamics</h1>
                <p>A soccer ball's "patches" are used to agiate the air the ball is infront of, thus creating low
                    pressure and decreasing the amount drag, therefore increasing the amount possible distance
                    travelled. This is also used to stop a soccer ball to stop it from "knuckling" which the player
                    kicks the ball with very little spin and causing the ball to spin towards the end of it flight
                    making the ball's trajectory unpredictable. The smoother the ball is, the higher the speed at which
                    the knuckling effect occurs. In recent years ball's have been developed to be quite rough therefore
                    decreasing the knuckling effect by &asymp; $48.28km^{-1}$ or $13.41ms^{-1}$. </p>

    <!-- Improving Ball Aerodynamics -->
    <section class="improving-aero bg-dark">
        <div class="improving-aero-content">
            <h1>Improving Ball Aerodynamics</h1>
            <p>A variety of techniques have been used to explore the dynamic and aerodynamic properties of sports balls
                to an ever-improving degree. Techniques have ranged from judgements by eye, to wind-tunnel tests and
                computational fluid dynamics, to measurements with paper to video!</p>

            <p> As these investigations have led to higher performing balls, sports have been significantly affected,
                to the degree that modifications to decrease performance, such as slower tennis balls, are being
                contemplated by the relevant regulatory bodies.</p>

            <p>Many balls operate at or near a critical Reynolds number, such that drag coefficient can be a strong
                function of flight speed. Substantial side or lift forces are developed by many balls via
                seam-triggered boundary layer transition and thus delayed separation; in other cases Magnus Effect lift
                plays the dominant role.</p>
